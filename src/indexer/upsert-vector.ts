 * Berlin's report asked for "a test asserting a stored vector ≠ embed('')"; that test is

 *    every daemon-indexed document got the same meaningless embedding.
 * 2. **An unusable vector fails the job.** A thrown error is marked on the queue row; a
 *    stored bad vector is invisible. Loud beats silent.
 *
 * Row *identity* is deliberately not handled here. `addDocuments` used to append on a
 * duplicate id — a re-index took one deployment from 3,325 to 3,953 rows — but that is an
 * adapter concern, and the LanceDB adapter now does a native `mergeInsert` upsert
 * (@DUMPDUMPY, #2796). Papering over it here would have fixed one caller and left every
