/**
 * The CI gate and the documented local gate must be the same command over the same suite.
 *
 * They were not. CI ran a hand-maintained `find(1)` list of 183 files — **15% of the 1,221
 * test files in this repo**. Whole directories were never executed, including
 * `tests/frontend/` (228 files) and `tests/build/`, which holds the 250-line ratchet and the
 * test-scope guard. Consequences, both real:
 *
 *  - #2848 left four tests red on `alpha` for hours while its check was green.
 *  - Two tests in `src/routes/menu/__tests__` had been red since #1857 (#2862).
 *
 * And the docs told contributors to run `bun test <path>` while CI ran
 * `bun test --isolate <path>` — different module semantics, so a local red could be a leaked
 * `mock.module` rather than a real failure, and a local green could be hiding one.
 *
 * Sibling of `test-scope.test.ts`, which exists because a *different* test-scoping bug (#2825)
 * also shipped silently. See #2853.
