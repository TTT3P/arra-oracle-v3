/**
 * Every API route cluster must stay mounted in the composed app.
 *
 * `src/server.ts` composes **33** route clusters into `apiModules`. Before this test, the only
 * mount assertions anywhere were four paths in `composition.test.ts` — `/`, `/api/health`,
 * `/api/auth/login`, `/api/menu`. Everything else could be dropped from `apiModules` and no
 * test would notice.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. It was found in `tests/http/fleet-log/`, where **31 tests passed
 * against a completely unmounted cluster** because they all call
 * `createFleetLogRoutes().handle(request)` — the cluster in isolation. Most route clusters here
 * are tested the same way, which is fine for behaviour and blind to wiring (#2879, #2923).
 *
 * ## Why segments rather than full paths
 *
 * Pinning all 201 `/api` paths would fail on every legitimate route addition and quickly get
 * deleted. The first segment after `/api` is a good proxy for "this cluster is present": adding
 * routes never removes a segment, so the guard only fires when a whole cluster disappears —
 * which is exactly the failure it exists to catch.
 *
 * Same shape as the file-size ratchet beside it: a list that may only shrink deliberately,
 * never by accident.
 *
 * Lives in tests/build/ rather than tests/integration/server-boot/ ON PURPOSE — CI does not run
 * tests/integration/ (it needs docker), and a guard that never runs is worthless. That exclusion
 * is also why composition.test.ts sat red on alpha unnoticed.
